Hi, I'm Cory, a Cloud and DevOps Engineer passionate about automation and cloud technologies.

My journey in tech began in 2010 as an IT intern at my local high school, but my fascination with technology started much earlier. As a kid, I spent countless hours tinkering with gaming consoles and PCs, modding them to explore their potential.

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions or crafting automation scripts, you'll find me traveling or taking advantage of the Colorado Rocky Mountain range. 

Please reach me at cory [at] coryair [dot] com to chat or collaborate!
